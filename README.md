# Darcy
Description and materials for a simple sand filter experiment that can be done at home. The objective is to determine the hydraulic conductivity, K, of a sample of sand or soil, and its drainable porosity. One also has to formulate the correct differential equation that governs the experiment based on Darcy's Law.
