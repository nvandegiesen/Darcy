    "Welcome to the Darcy experiment, which is one of the practical exercises in CTB2410. In this notebook, you will find the tools to analyse your data and determine the two soil parameters we want to find, drainable porosity, $DP$ (-), and hydraulic conductivity, $K$ (m/s). Note that we will mainly use meters and seconds, which may result in some very small numbers as aquifers can have conductivities as low as a few meters per month. You may first simply want to run the Notebook as is to see what the idea is. Data from a a test have been included for this purpose.\n"

    "Save this Jupyter Notebook and **make a copy as pdf** before zipping the complete directory. The pdf serves easy checking of the main content. The other files (pictures, Notebook, csv, xlc) serve to check details in case of unclarities. Probably the easiest way to make a pdf is to go to the 'File' menu of Jupyter, then select 'Print Preview', then right-click on the print preview that opens up, and choose to 'Save to pdf'. There is also a 'Download as PDF via LaTeX' option, but this requires additional software installation. Make sure all filenames, including that of Notebook and pdf start with your student number.\n",
